# Gate Detection

## Underwater Object Detection using TensorFlow

This repository created to train a model and detect an underwater object using tensorflow API.

Our team works on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to prepare for [Singapore AUV Challange](https://sauvc.org/) and the [RoboSub'20](https://robonation.org/programs/robosub/).
