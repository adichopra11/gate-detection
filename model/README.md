## Decide the Model

The object API provides some sample checkpoints and configurations to choose from. I will use <i><b>ssd-mobilenet</b></i>.

> [model](ssd_mobilenet/) and [configuration](../training/ssd_mobilenet.config) files

You can check out some of the other checkpoint options to start with from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). And for the configuration files check out [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs).
